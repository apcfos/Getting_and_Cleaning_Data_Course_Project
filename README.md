# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

# Purpose

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
    
# Steps

1. Download the data source and save it on your local drive
2. Set the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset folder as working directory
3. Save run_analysis.R in the parent folder
4. Source("run_analysis.R") that generates a new file tidy_data.txt in your working directory
